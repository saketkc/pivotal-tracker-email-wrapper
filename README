Pivotal Tracker Ruby wrapper to Add New Stories to an existent project by sending an email to a specific email id which 
acts like a bot id say bot@botmail.com. The main.rb file could be run as a Cron task to constantly monitor this email id.
To Add a new Story to an existent Project the Format of the Email should be as follows:
FromL requester_of_the_story@botmail.com
To: bot@botmail.com
CC: owner_of_the_story@botmil.com
Subject: [Project Name][Story Type][Story Title]
Body : Story Description

****The Square brackets in subject line are compulsory 
The person to whom the Story needs to be assigned needs to be CCed to this particular mail,
else the requester of the email(the FROM field of the email) will be assigned the story himself !

The following files are contained :
i).   settings.rb
ii).  config.rb
iii). requirements.rb
iv).  main.rb

i). settings.rb
This file acts as the "Token Generator". Running this should be a one time affair(per user) for generating their corres
ponding tokens. It is essential to generate tokens for all the members of the projects. 
Everytime this file is run it appends the generated token to the "config.rb" file.
***Pivotal username is case sensitive . No error will be generated in case you enter a wrong username but 
it may lead to erros while requesting/owning stories as Pivotal depeneds upon the "username" of the member and
not his email id

ii). config.rb

This file stores all the generated TOKENS 

iii). requirements.rb

This file contains all the "require" statements.

iv). main.rb

This is the file that can be run as a cron task . This file montitors the bot IMAP account sa bot@botmail.com
.All the incoming amils to this bot IMAP are constantly monitored for the pattern in 
Subject:[Project Name][Story Type(feature/bug/chores)][Story Title] . Once this format is detected it fetches 
the Project id corrreposnding to the Project name and then Adds a Story corresponding to the requester 
against the owner.
